## Fixing an Issue
If you find an issue (typo, incorrect information, layout problem, etc.) you're welcome to try and fix it yourself and make a pull request or simply open an issue. 

For the "incorrect information" category of issues, if the statement is subjective, it's probably worth mentioning on the discussion thread for the post before 
opening an issue or pull request.


## New Ideas
If you have an idea for an improvement to the site or new blog post topic, please add that to discussions under the "Ideas" category.


## Questions
There is a Q&A section of discussions just for this, ask away!
