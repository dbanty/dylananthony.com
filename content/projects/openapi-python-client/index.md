Generate idiomatic Python code from OpenAPI documents.

<!-- more -->

I started this generator to fulfill the needs of my (at the time) employer: generate Python code with type annotations which doesn't carry Python 2 baggage and supports async requests. It has since evolved into a natural place for Python developers to contribute to their own generator, rather than needing to learn a bunch of Java syntax to modify things.
