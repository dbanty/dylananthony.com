### What I Do

I spend most of my time improving the GraphQL developer experience in [Rust]. I also maintain a couple open source projects such as [openapi-python-client] and [Knope].

In my free time, I blog about various topics that interest me on [my personal website][website].

My main languages are [Rust] 🦀 and Python 🐍 but I dabble in just about everything.

### What I Like

🥰 I'm big on improving developer productivity and experience, which are the themes of my open source work.

🧐 Quality is core to everything I do. I want little more than for all the software in the world to be better, faster, and less frustrating to users. That's why I like using Rust wherever feasible and type annotations (with mypy) in all my Python. Quality also includes things like:
- Security 🔒
- Testing 🧪
- Monitoring 🪵
- Documentation 📜

🤓 Learning! I'm always looking to learn new things, and love getting feedback and recommendations!

💜 The most important thing to me is being kind. I will look for any opportunity to foster a more welcoming community and eliminate hostile environments. The only thing intolerable is intolerance itself.
