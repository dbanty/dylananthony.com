    <h3>What I Do</h3>

    <p>
        I spend most of my time improving the GraphQL developer experience in
        <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/foreword.html">Rust</a>.
        I also maintain a couple open source projects such as
        <a href="https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client">openapi-python-client</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/knope-dev/knope">Knope</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My main languages are
        <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/foreword.html">Rust</a> 🦀 and Python 🐍 but I dabble in just about everything.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Like</h3>

    <p>🥰 I'm big on improving developer productivity and experience, which are the themes of my open source work.</p>

    <p>
        🧐 Quality is core to everything I do. I want little more than for all the software in the world to be better,
        faster, and less frustrating to users. That's why I like using Rust wherever feasible and type annotations
        (with mypy) in all my Python. Quality also includes things like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Security 🔒</li>
        <li>Testing 🧪</li>
        <li>Monitoring 🪵</li>
        <li>Documentation 📜</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        🤓 Learning! I'm always looking to learn new things, and love getting feedback and recommendations!
    </p>

    <p>
        💜 The most important thing to me is being kind. I will look for any opportunity to foster a more welcoming
        community and eliminate hostile environments. The only thing intolerable is intolerance itself.
