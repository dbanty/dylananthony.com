Taking a break from OpenAPI for a bit, I decided to explore the primary alternative for web API developmentâ€”GraphQL. I've been pleasantly surprised so far at how easy it's been to write a GraphQL API using Rust, _much_ easier than doing so with the OpenAPI tools I've tested so far.

## The Options

There are two real contenders for GraphQL crates: [async-graphql] and [Juniper]. Having read briefly through both sets of documentation, [async-graphql] seemed like the more feature-rich and better-documented option, so that's what I went with. If someone has experience with Juniper and thinks it might be a better choice, please leave a note [in the discussion thread][discussion]!

The good news is that both solutions are fairly feature-complete using stable Rust and neither is tightly coupled to a web server! You'll know this is perfect for my use-cases if you've read [my previous posts][fastapi-rust-research] where I repeatedly jumped through hoops shoe-horning a web server into a serverless environment.

## The Setup

As I mentioned, I went with [async-graphql] as the primary crate to build my experiment with. I used a similar AWS CDK setup as in [my previous post][fastapi-rust-lambda] since it was the easiest and most robust way to both test Rust lambdas locally and to deploy them to AWS.

> Interested in seeing how to apply this CDK setup to Python applications? Upvote [this idea thread][python cdk idea].
