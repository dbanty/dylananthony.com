This is the source code for my website which, right now, is just a blog. The site uses Next.js hosted on Vercel because
it's the best front end web development experience I found **by far**. Want to build a site just like it? I started
with the [Next.js blog starter example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) and am
slowly customizing from there.
